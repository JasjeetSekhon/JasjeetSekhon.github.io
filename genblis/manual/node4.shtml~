<BR>
General Setup
</H1>
The <B>general setup</B> section of the model specification (modelspec) file
started at the very beginning of the file.  The format of the section is
<TT>keyword</TT> for the desired option followed by a space and then any
arguments (numbers or filenames) needed for the option.

<P>
The following option keywords may be included in this section.  Most of the
options are set to a default value if no definition is given in the modelspec
file.  Most of the keywords may appear in any order, but they must be
separated by either spaces or line breaks and they must appear in the General
Setup section.  The General Setup section ends with the keyword
<TT>model</TT>--see the <A HREF="node9.shtml#example:top">example model specification files</A>.

<P>
The keywords <TT>dataset</TT>, <TT>observedvars</TT> and <TT>latentvars</TT>
must be included with specified values because they don't have a default value
and are required.  The <TT>ngroups</TT> option must be specified if multigroup
processing is to occur; in this case <TT>ngroups</TT> must be specified first,
before the other three options.

<P>
<UL><A NAME="general:ngroups">&#160;</A><LI><TT>ngroups</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>ngroups</TT> <I>integer</I> <BR>
Default: 1 <BR>
This keyword <I>must</I> be specified if data from multiple groups are
  to be processed in parallel.  The integer argument specifies the number
  of groups.  This number must equal the number of files named in the
  <TT>datafile</TT> option and the number of variable numbers listed in the
  <TT>observedvars</TT> option.  If there is only one group, then this
  option may be omitted and the default value of 1 will be used.

<P>
<A NAME="general:datafile">&#160;</A><LI><TT>datafile</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>datafile</TT> <I>path-to-file</I> [<I>path-to-file</I> ...] <BR>
Default: none <BR>
This keyword precedes the path to where the dataset of raw observations is
  located.  There can be a maximum of 4096 characters in any path name used in
  GENBLIS.  This is a longer path than many operating systems allow.  The data
  are read from the dataset by observation, using the variable number
  <I>integer</I> specified in the <TT>observedvars</TT> option: the first
  <I>integer</I> values in the dataset become the values of the observed
  variables for the first observation, the next <I>integer</I> values in the
  dataset become the values of the observed variables for the next
  observation, etc.  Each value is translated from ascii (character)
  representation to a double precision floating point number (C type double;
  the C-language format used to scan [fscanf] the ascii representations is
  %lf).  Numbers in the raw data files must be delimited by whitespace.
  GENBLIS sets the number of observations equal to the number of observations
  read in this manner from the dataset.  If multigroup processing is desired,
  the data for each group must be placed in a separate file, each of which is
  named in succession after the <TT>datafile</TT> keyword.  The number of
  filenames must equal the value of the argument to the <TT>ngroups</TT>
  option.  Each dataset is processed in parallel, in the fashion described for
  a single dataset.
<LI><TT>observedvars</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>observedvars</TT> <I>integer</I> [<I>integer</I> ...] <BR>
Default: none <BR>
This variable must be set to the number of observed variables in the
  data.  The number is equal to the number of variables which are read in from
  the data file.  This specifies the number of rows in the model matrix
  named 
<!-- MATH: $\Lambda_{y}$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img17.gif"
 ALT="$\Lambda_{y}$">
(see <A HREF="node5.shtml#eq:sigma">the model equation</A>).  If multigroup processing is desired, the number of
  observed variables for each group must be listed.  The order of the numbers
  must match the order of the raw datasets named in the <TT>datafile</TT>
  option.  A number must be specified for each file, even if all the numbers
  are equal.  In the GENBLIS <TT>model</TT> section, the observed variables
  are referred to by number in order across all groups.  For instance, if
  there are six variables in each of two groups, the <TT>observedvars</TT>
  option would read ``<TT>observedvars</TT>&nbsp;6&nbsp;6'' and in the <TT>model</TT>
  section the observed variables in the first group would have numbers 1-6
  while the observed variables in the second group would have numbers 7-12.
  The 
<!-- MATH: $\Lambda_{y}$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img17.gif"
 ALT="$\Lambda_{y}$">
matrix has 12 rows in this case.

<P>
<LI><TT>latentvars</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>latentvars</TT> <I>integer</I> <BR>
Default: none <BR>
The variable sets the number of latent variable present in the model to be
  estimated.  This specifies the number of rows and columns in the model
  matrices named <I>B</I> and <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img18.gif"
 ALT="$\Psi$">,
and the number of columns in the matrix named
  
<!-- MATH: $\Lambda_{y}$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img17.gif"
 ALT="$\Lambda_{y}$">
(see <A HREF="node5.shtml#eq:sigma">the model equation</A>).
  In a multigroup model, this number must count all the latent variables in
  all the groups.  For example, in a model with two groups and a one-factor
  model in each group, there are two latent variables.
</UL>

<P>
The remaining variables need not be set by the user. 

<P>
<UL>
<LI><TT>bootseed</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>bootseed</TT> <I>integer</I> <BR>
Default: 707070 <BR>
There are two random number generators used by GENBLIS and hence two random
  number seeds: <TT>genoudseed</TT> and <TT>bootseed</TT>.  This option sets
  the random number seed for generating the bootstrap resamples.  This number
  must be an integer.  For each seed, a unique series of random numbers is
  generated.  This option allows one to replicate results.  If both
  <TT>bootseed</TT> and <TT>genoudseed</TT> are not changed, each and every
  execution of GENBLIS with the same data and model will produce
  <I>exactly</I> the same results.  GENBLIS will generate and then use
  exactly the same random numbers.

<P>
<LI><TT>bootstraps</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>bootstraps</TT> <I>integer</I> <BR>
Default: 1000 <BR>
This variable sets the number of bootstrap resamples which are used to
  calculate the bootstrap confidence intervals for the parameters and to
  estimate the bootstrap confidence interval for the goodness-of-fit test.

<P>
<LI><TT>bootstrapdetails</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>bootstrapdetails</TT> <BR>
Default: The details of the BC<SUB><I>a</I></SUB> bootstrap are not presented.  <BR>
By default GENBLIS prints the BC<SUB><I>a</I></SUB> confidence intervals.  If this
  option is selected, along with the BC<SUB><I>a</I></SUB> bootstrap confidence
  intervals, GENBLIS will print the values of the bias (
<!-- MATH: $\hat{z}_{0}$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img20.gif"
 ALT="$\hat{z}_{0}$">)
and
  acceleration adjustments (
<!-- MATH: $\hat{\alpha}$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img21.gif"
 ALT="$\hat{\alpha}$">)
for the BC<SUB><I>a</I></SUB> bootstrap.
  For details please see Efron and Tibshirani, <I>An Introduction to
    the Bootstrap</I>, (New York: Chapman &amp; Hall), pp.325ff.

<P>
<LI><TT>covmatrix</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>covmatrix</TT> <BR>
Default: The asymptotic covariance matrix is not printed. <BR>
If this option is listed, the estimated asymptotic covariance matrix of
  the parameter estimates is printed.

<P>
<LI><TT>genconverge</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>genconverge</TT> <I>integer</I> <BR>
Default value: 5.  <BR>
This option sets the number of generations <I>after</I> GENBLIS thinks
  it has converged it ought to keep going.  This number must be an integer.
  GENBLIS thinks it has converged if the gradients at the best solution
  found so far are below a criterion defined below.  It is often good to
  keep GENBLIS working after this point because the evolutionary program
  (EP) portion of GENBLIS continues to provide useful non-local information.
  Obviously, the higher this number is, the greater security one has that a
  global optimum has been found.

<P>
<LI><TT>genmax</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>genmax</TT> <I>integer</I> <BR>
Default: 100 <BR>
This variable sets the maximum number of generations.  Recall that theory
  suggests that the size of the population of genetic operators is of greater
  practical importance than the number of generations.  The asymptotics are
  primarily in operator population size:  it will not work to run a very large
  number of generations if the operator population is too small.  But
  optimization will also fail if the generation limit is set too small.  Use
  the <A HREF="node8.shtml#controls:top"><B>genetic operator controls</B></A> to change the population of
  operators.

<P>
<LI><TT>genoudseed</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>genoudseed</TT> <I>integer</I> <BR>
Default value: 0 <BR>
There are two random number generators used by GENBLIS and hence two random
  number seeds: <TT>genoudseed</TT> and <TT>bootseed</TT>.  This options sets
  the random number seed for GENOUD which is the evolutionary program heart of
  GENBLIS.  This number must be an integer.  For each seed, a unique series of
  random numbers is generated.  This option allows one to replicate results.
  If both <TT>bootseed</TT> and <TT>genoudseed</TT> are not changed, each and
  every execution of GENBLIS with the same data and model will produce
  <I>exactly</I> the same results.  GENBLIS will generate and then use
  exactly the same random numbers.
<LI><TT>listfile</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>listfile</TT> <I>path-to-file</I> <BR>
Default: the name of the model specification file plus the <TT>.lst</TT>
  extension. <BR>
In addition to the output which GENBLIS by default sends to standard out,
  GENBLIS creates a list file which contains a summary of the results.  The
  list file provides a description of the estimated model, the options
  chosen, and the results requested.  The list file does not provide the
  details of program execution.  By default GENBLIS sends this list output
  to a file it creates with the same name as the model specification file
  plus the extension <TT>.lst</TT>.  For example, if the specified model
  specification file is entitled <TT>1run</TT> the default list file will
  be <TT>1run.lst</TT> and it will be created in the directory from which
  GENBLIS is executed.  The name for the list file can be chosen using the
  <TT>listfile</TT> option--please see the General Setup section.

<P>
<LI><TT>noboots</TT> <BR>
Usage: list <TT>noboots</TT> in the modelspec file to turn
  <B>off</B> the bootstrap routine.
  Default: the bootstrap routine is turned <B>on</B>. <BR>
By default GENBLIS provides bootstrap confidence intervals for the linear
  structure model parameter estimates and provides a bootstrap goodness-of-fit
  test.
<LI><TT>nobig</TT> <BR>
Usage: list <TT>nobig</TT> in the modelspec file to turn <B>off</B>
  using <TT>control.big</TT>. <BR>
Default: control.big is used. <BR>
GENBLIS has four different control setups: <TT>control</TT> (used for the
  original sample), <TT>control.big</TT> (used in the original sample and when
  there is a convergence failure in either the jackknives or the bootstraps),
  <TT>control.jack</TT> (used for the jackknives), and <TT>control.boot</TT>
  (used for the bootstraps).  When the <TT>nobig</TT> option is used GENBLIS
  estimates only the original sample using the control file and then stops.
  Neither jackknives nor bootstraps are done.
<LI><TT>nojacks</TT> <BR>
Usage: list <TT>nojacks</TT> in the modelspec file to turn <B>off</B>
  the jackknife routine. <BR>
Default: the jackknife is turned <B>on</B>.  <BR>
By default jackknives are done by GENBLIS because they are required in order
  to estimate the bootstrap confidence intervals produced by GENBLIS.  The
  jackknives are usually done after the linear structure model is estimated in
  the original sample (i.e., in the the observed dataset) and before the model
  is estimated in bootstrap resamples.  If one wants neither jackknives nor
  any bootstrap resamples, then one must set <TT>nojacks</TT> and set
  <TT>bootstraps</TT> to 0.  These two options are usually used together
  except for diagnostic purposes.  The bootstraps will not provide useful
  information without the jackknives.

<P>
<LI><TT>readrecordfile</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>readrecordfile</TT> <I>path-to-file</I> <BR>
Default: none <BR>
This keyword precedes the path to a GENBLIS record file which will be
  read by GENBLIS.  See the <TT>recordfile</TT> option for a full
  discussion.  

<P>
<LI><TT>recordfile</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>recordfile</TT> <I>path-to-file</I> <BR>
Default: none <BR>
This keyword precedes the path to the file GENBLIS will write its record
  file. The record file is an ASCII file which records all of GENBLIS's
  results--i.e., in the original sample and in jackknife and bootstrap
  resamples. This file is not needed to run GENBLIS. But it is useful if
  one stops GENBLIS in the middle, and then wants to start it again. The
  <TT>readrecordfile</TT> option allows GENBLIS to finish a run started by
  another execution. These options are especially useful when in one or
  more bootstrap resamples convergence is difficult to obtain. One can
  obtain convergence in the relatively easy cases and then restart GENBLIS
  with a large genetic population--see the Genetic Operator Controls
  section.

<P>
<LI><TT>onboundary</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>onboundary</TT> <I>floating-point number</I> <BR>
Default value: 0.000001 <BR>
An estimated variance must be above this number or GENBLIS considers that
  variance to be on the boundary--i.e., 0.  This is known as a ``Heywood
  case.''  When a variance is on the boundary, the remaining parameters,
  including the non-zero variances, are estimated as usual, albeit with the
  on-boundary parameter treated as if it were fixed equal to the boundary
  value.  In many cases the results from this approach will not be meaningful,
  so if an on-boundary situation occurs it is extremely important to recheck
  the data and model specification.  Rechecking is especially called for if
  the on-boundary situation occurs in the original sample of data.  If a
  variance goes below the <TT>onboundary</TT> threshold, GENBLIS prints
  ``boundary-hit threshold'' and goes on to estimate the remaining parameters.

<P>
<LI><TT>usecorr</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>usecorr</TT> <BR>
Default: analyze the sample correlation matrix <BR>
Specify this keyword to analyze the sample product-moment correlation
  matrix.  If none of the keywords <TT>usecov</TT>, <TT>usecorr</TT> or
  <TT>usecrossp</TT> are specified, GENBLIS will analyze the covariance
  matrix.  If more than one of the three keywords is specified, the one
  occurring last in the General Setup section will take effect.

<P>
<LI><TT>usecov</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>usecov</TT> <BR>
Default: analyze the sample covariance matrix <BR>
Specify this keyword to analyze the sample covariance matrix.  If none of
  the keywords <TT>usecov</TT>, <TT>usecorr</TT> or <TT>usecrossp</TT> are
  specified, GENBLIS will analyze the covariance matrix.  If more than one of
  the three keywords is specified, the one occurring last in the General Setup
  section will take effect.

<P>
<LI><TT>usecrossp</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>usecrossp</TT> <BR>
Default: analyze the mean sample crossproduct matrix <BR>
Specify this keyword to analyze the sample crossproduct matrix (the simple
  crossproduct matrix is divided by the number of observations, or by the sum
  of the weight values specified by the <TT>weights</TT> option).  If none of
  the keywords <TT>usecov</TT>, <TT>usecorr</TT> or <TT>usecrossp</TT> are
  specified, GENBLIS will analyze the covariance matrix.  If more than one of
  the three keywords is specified, the one occurring last in the General Setup
  section will take effect.  

<P>
<LI><TT>use_out_of_bounds</TT>
<BR>
Usage: list <TT>use_out_of_bounds</TT> in the modelspec file to turn this
  option <B>on</B>. <BR>
Default: option is <B>off</B>.
<BR>
This option tells GENBLIS if it should use parameter values which are
  out of the bounds set in the modelspec file (the setting of bounds is
  discussed later).  When this option is on, GENBLIS uses the bounds
  information provided to focus its search.  However, GENBLIS will allow
  searching outside of the bounds.  If this occurs, a message will be
  printed in standard output informing the user that GENBLIS is using
  values outside of the bounds.  If this option is off, as is the default,
  GENBLIS will constrain optimization within the bounds but will print a
  message that it wishes to go outside of the bounds.  It is sometimes wise,
  however, to ignore GENBLIS if one wishes to extensively search one region
  of the parameter space.

<P>
<LI><TT>weights</TT> <BR>
Usage: <TT>weights</TT> <I>path-to-file</I> [<I>path-to-file</I> ...] <BR>
Default: none <BR>
This keyword precedes the path to where a dataset of numbers to use as
  observation weights is located.  If this option is specified, each
  observation is multiplied by the corresponding weight value whenever there
  is summing over the data to compute sample means, covariances or other
  sample moments.  The resulting sum is divided by the sum of the weights,
  rather than by the unweighted number of observations.  The weights are used
  for sample moments computed in each bootstrap resample; each weight always
  remains correctly associated with the original sample observation data
  vector.  If multigroup processing is being used, the weighting data for each
  group must be placed in a separate file, each of which is named in
  succession after the <TT>weights</TT> keyword.  The number of filenames must
  equal the value of the argument to the <TT>ngroups</TT> option.  The number
  of weight values in each file must equal the number of observations in the
  dataset named in the corresponding position in the <TT>datafile</TT> option.
  GENBLIS may not complain if the numbers do not match, but in general the
  results in case of a mismatch will be garbage.  When weights are used the
  sample covariance matrix is computed with denominator equal to the sum of
  the weights.  When weights are not used the denominator is <I>n</I>-1, where <I>n</I>
  is the number of observations (or, with multigroup processing, the number of
  observations in the relevant group).

<P>
</UL>

<P>
Although the <TT>genadd</TT> and <TT>cases</TT> variables are no longer
used by GENBLIS, including them in the model specification file will not
cause an error.  These variables are simply ignored.

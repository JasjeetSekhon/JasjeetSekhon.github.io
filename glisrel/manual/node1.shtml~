The Optimization Problem</A>
</H1>
The gradient-based optimization algorithms most often used with structural
equation models (Levenberg-Marquardt, Newton-Raphson, quasi-Newton) are
inadequate because they too often fail to find the global maximum of the
likelihood function.  The discrepancy function is not globally convex.
Multiple, local minima and saddlepoints often exist, so that there is no
guarantee that gradient-based methods will converge to the global maximum.
Indeed, saddlepoints and other complexities in the curvature of the
likelihood function can make it difficult for gradient-based optimization
methods to find any maximum at all.  Such difficulties are intrinsic to
linear structure models for two reasons.  First, the LISREL likelihood is not
globally concave.  Second, linear structure models' identification conditions do not
require and do not guarantee that the model (as a function of the data)
will determine a unique set of parameter values outside a neighborhood of
the true values.  The derivatives of the likelihood function with respect
to the parameters are not well defined outside of the neighborhood of the
solution.  Therefore, outside of the neighborhood of the solution,
derivative based methods often have little or no information upon which to
advance to the global maximum.

<P>
Bootstrap methodology accentuates optimization difficulties, because the
bootstrap resampling distribution draws from the entire distribution of the
parameter estimates.  Even if optimization in the original sample is not
problematic, one can expect to encounter difficulties in a significant
number of bootstrap resamples.  Even if the model being estimated is
correctly specified, problematic resamples contain crucial information
about the tails of the distribution of the parameter estimates.  Indeed,
what bootstrap methods primarily do is make corrections for skewness--for
asymmetry between the tails of the distribution of each parameter
estimate--that is ignored by normal-theory confidence limit estimates.
Tossing out the tail information basically defeats the purpose of using the
bootstrap to improve estimated confidence intervals.  In general, any
procedure of replacing problematic resamples with new resampling draws
until optimization is easy must fail, as making such replacements would
induce incomplete coverage of the parameter estimates' sampling
distribution and therefore incorrect inferences.  <A HREF="node18.shtml#ref:ichikawa95">Ichikawa and
  Konishi (1995)</A> make this mistake.

<P>
Because the nonexistence of good MLEs in bootstrap resamples is evidence of
misspecification and because the occurrence of failures affects the
coverage of the bootstrap confidence intervals, it is crucial to use an
optimization method that finds the global minimum of the discrepancy
function if one exists.  In order to overcome the problems of local minima
and nonconvergence from poor starting values, GENBLIS combines a
gradient-based method with an evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm.  Our
EP algorithm uses a collection of random and homotopy search operators that
combine members of a population of candidate solutions to produce a
population that on average better fits the current data.  <A HREF="node18.shtml#ref:nix92">Nix and
  Vose (1992;</A> <A HREF="node18.shtml#ref:vose93">Vose 1993)</A> prove that
genetic algorithms are asymptotically correct, in the sense that the
probability of converging to the best possible population of candidate
solutions goes to one as the population size increases to infinity.
Because they have a similar Markov chain structure, EP algorithms of the
kind we use are asymptotically correct in the same sense.  For a linear structure
model and a data set for which a good MLE (global minimum) exists, the best
possible population is the one in which all but a small fraction of the
candidate solutions have that value.  A fraction of the population will
have different values because the algorithm must include certain random
variations in order to have effective global search properties.  The
probability of not finding a good MLE when one exists can be made
arbitrarily small by increasing the population size used in the algorithm.

<P>
The EP is very good at finding a neighborhood of the global minimum in
which the discrepancy function is convex.  But the search operators, which
do not use derivatives, are quite slow at getting from an arbitrary point
in that neighborhood to the global minimum value.  We add the
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton optimizer as an
operator to do the final hill-climbing.  We developed and implemented a
general form of this EP-BFGS algorithm in a C program called Genetic
Optimization Using Derivatives
(<A NAME="tex2html12"
 HREF="http://data.fas.harvard.edu/jsekhon/genoud/">GENOUD</A>) .
GENBLIS is a version of GENOUD specifically tuned to estimate linear structure
models.

<P>
In our experience the program finds the global minimum solution for the
LISREL estimation problem in all cases where the most widely used software
fails, except where extensive examination suggests that a solution does not
exist.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Program Syntax</A>
</H1>
There are two general versions of GENBLIS.  The first runs on UNIX
systems (e.g., AIX, HP-UX, <A NAME="tex2html13"
 HREF="http://www.linux.org">LINUX</A>)
and the binary is called <TT>genblis</TT>.  The second version is a 32 bit
Windows 95/98/NT application.  The Windows binary is called
<TT>genblis.exe</TT>.  The Windows version of GENBLIS runs in a DOS window
(and currently has only a command-line interface), but it is <I>not</I> a
DOS application.  It is a true 32 bit Windows application.

<P>
The GENBLIS program is a command line program which reads a model
specification (modelspec) file and produces output to files specified in
the modelspec file and to standard output.  The name of the model
specification file is expected by GENBLIS on the command line.  For
example, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>unix&gt; genblis files/example1</TT> <BR>
<TT>windows dos shell&gt; genblis c:<code>\</code>files<code>\</code>example1
</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
In either case GENBLIS will read the file named <TT>example1</TT> which is
located in the <TT>files</TT> directory.

<P>
GENBLIS can take two command line options.  The first, as described above,
names the model specification file.  The second names the file to which
GENBLIS will send its output.  If this second option is not given, GENBLIS
sends its output to standard out.  It is advised that on UNIX systems one use
the redirection capabilities of the shell to redirect this output to a file or
to wherever else one wishes.  In Windows, however, GENBLIS handles the
redirection to a file better than the OS does.  Several versions of Windows
will buffer the redirected output until the GENBLIS process ends.  This can be
extremely annoying because GENBLIS will not produce any output while the
process is running to inform the user of its current status.  Therefore, in
Windows it is highly suggested that one provide the second command line option
naming the output file.  In UNIX and particularly in Windows it is not
recommended that GENBLIS be allowed to send output to the screen.  Screen
output comes at a significant performance cost.  Therefore, it is best to
redirect standard output to a file either by providing a second command line
option naming the output file (in Windows) or by redirecting the output
(UNIX).

<P>
In addition to the output which GENBLIS by default sends to standard out,
GENBLIS creates a list file which contains a summary of the results.  The
list file provides a description of the estimated model, the options
chosen, and the results requested.  The list file does not provide the
details of program execution.  By default GENBLIS sends this list output to
a file it creates with the same name as the model specification file plus
the extension <TT>.lst</TT>.  For example, if the specified model
specification file is entitled <TT>1run</TT> the default list file will be
<TT>1run.lst</TT> and it will be created in the directory from which
GENBLIS is executed.  The name of the list file can be chosen using the
<TT>listfile</TT> option--please see the <A HREF="node4.shtml#general:top">General Setup
  section</A>.

<P>
All error messages are sent to general output and to standard error.  One
may, therefore, see an error message displayed in duplicate if both standard
error and standard out are being directed to the same location.

<P>
The modelspec file has five different parts the first three of which are
required: <A HREF="node4.shtml#general:top"><B>general setup</B></A>; <A HREF="node5.shtml#modelspec:top"><B>linear structure model
    definition</B></A>; <A HREF="node6.shtml#bounds:top"><B>parameter bounds</B></A>; <A HREF="node7.shtml#starting:top"><B>starting
    values</B></A>; and
<A HREF="node8.shtml#controls:top"><B>genetic operator controls</B></A>.

<P>
<A NAME="syntax:comments">&#160;</A>Comments are allowed in the model specification file.  Comments begin with
# and continue until the end of the line.  Lines must be no longer than
4096 characters.  Comments are not allowed to appear between a variable
name and its setting.  For example, when the name of the data file is being
set, a comment cannot appear between <TT>datafile</TT> and the
filename--<A HREF="node4.shtml#general:datafile">see <TT>datafile</TT> description</A>.  Only
white space may appear between a variable name and its setting.  White
space includes space, tab, and end-of-line characters.

<P>
GENBLIS is case sensitive.  With the exception of a few special commands,
the model specification file must be written completely in lower case.

<P>
Setting up a GENBLIS model specification file is not as difficult as the
following text may lead one to believe.  There are a large number of
options, but they need not be used.  It is probably best to look at the
provided example model specification files.  Four example model
specification files are provided with the binary distribution of GENBLIS.
Please see <A HREF="node9.shtml#example:top">the Example Files section</A>
for more details.

<h2>
Linux versus Mac OS X and Windows XP on Intel Dual Core
</h2>

<br>

<I> With the help of a variety of developers working at Apple and
elsewhere, the large OS X performance gap previously reported here has
been eliminated.  This can be accomplished by either algorithmic
changes or by the use of an alternative memory allocator for OS X.
The underlying issue is that for my code the default malloc on OS X,
like the default malloc on Windows XP, causes a large performance
degradation which the default mallocs on Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD do
not.  <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> developers use the
default system malloc on every operating system but Windows.  It turns
out that this decision is a bad one in the case of OS X because its
memory allocator goes to the virtual memory system, instead of the
application heap, for fresh pages starting at 15KB while Lea's
allocator makes the switch at 128KB.  But if the benchmark code is
modified to either use an alternative (memory efficient) algorithm or
Doug Lea's malloc, OS X performs well on these benchmarks. </I>

<br><br> 

The efficiency of the malloc implementation has a large impact because
in my original code malloc was being called in the inner loop due to
the use of the <a href="http://scythe.wustl.edu/">Scythe Statistical
Library</a>.  This library does not require that the dimensions of
matrices be explicitly declared.  In my updated algorithm not only are
these dimensions declared at the time of variable creation, key
operations now make use of system <a
href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">BLAS</a> libraries.  These changes
make the code faster on all platforms.  However, there is a tradeoff.
The original code made extensive use of the <a
href="http://scythe.wustl.edu/">Scythe Statistical Library</a> which
allows for the quick development of C++ code that is faster than R (an
interpreted language). One can certainly write more efficient C++ code
(the new version of my package which uses optimized system BLAS is an
example).  But code using Scythe is clear and straightforward to
write, read and debug especially for R programmers because it uses a
similar syntax.  Therefore, it is reasonable for developers to use
Scythe even though there are more efficient alternatives.

<br><br>

The claims that I had previously made about the inefficiency of OS X
system calls relative to Linux still hold although system calls are
not an issue for these benchmarks.  For example, as one email
corresponded noted, compare <a
href="http://cvs.opendarwin.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/xnu/bsd/dev/ppc/systemcalls.c?rev=1.3&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">Darwin
system call handling</a> versus the <a
href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/arch/ppc/kernel/entry.S">Linux
equivalent</a> (Tiger version is available <a
href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.4.6.ppc/xnu-792.6.70/bsd/dev/ppc/systemcalls.c">here</a>). <a
href="http://www.anandtech.com/">Anandtech</a> (<a
href="http://www.anandtech.com/mac/showdoc.aspx?i=2436">Part I</a>
and <a
href="http://www.anandtech.com/mac/showdoc.aspx?i=2520&p=8">Part
II</a>) has conducted a series of benchmarks relevant to this issue,
and Darwin is slower than the 2.6 Linux kernel in these benchmarks
sometimes by several times.

<br><br>



For the curious, the original (now outdated) benchmarks are still reported
below.
</I>


<br><br>

<h4 class="Benchmarks">Original Benchmarks</h4>
<br>

I present here a set of benchmarks which are relevant to my work and
to people working in statistical computing, particular people using
the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R Project for Statistical
Computing</a>.  These benchmarks are floating point bound where the
main IO is to memory and not to disk.  <B> Memory allocation and
management is a central issue.</B> And cache and Translation
Look-aside Buffer (TLB) misses really matter.  This setup may be of
more general interest.  But they may not be relevant for what you do.
If you need a computer to do <I>Y</I>, and these benchmarks are in no
way related to <I>Y</I>, don't write me to complain about it.  These
benchmarks are useful for the work <b> I
</b> and some other computational statistics people do.

<br><br>

The default memory manager in OS X is awful.  To quote <a
href="http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/~kgoto/">Kazushige Goto</a> talking
about his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blas">BLAS</a>:
"<B>Performance is suppressed on purpose due to [the] awful memory
management of OS X</B>".  Goto's work is described and praised on <a
href="http://www.apple.com/education/science/profiles/vatech/optimization.html">Apple's
own website</a> because he added a custom BLAS for the Apple super
computer at <a href="http://www.tcf.vt.edu/systemX.html">Virginia
Tech</a>.  On the Apple site it states that Goto was "pulling out
incredible efficiencies".  Given Goto's own benchmarks and comments,
it is not surprising that the Virginia Tech team was able to pull out
these efficiencies by writing a kernel level memory manager to work
around OS X's memory manager (information provided via email by their
Director of HPC and Technology Innovation).  The custom kernel level
memory manager is not mentioned on <a
href="http://www.apple.com/science/profiles/vatech/">Apple's
webpage</a> so the impression is left that the excellent performance
achieved by the Virginia Tech team is possible with the standard
operating system.  In what follows the default OS X memory allocator
is used as is the default one on Linux (ptmalloc).  It appears that on
Windows, R defaults to using <a
href="http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html">Doug Lea's</a> memory
allocator.  The memory allocators used for these benchmarks are the
default allocators which R uses for the various platforms.  I have in
no way altered R's defaults.

<br>
<br>

The benchmarks presented here are based on two of my statistical
software packages for <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>: <a
href="../matching">Matching</a> (Multivariate and Propensity Score
Matching Software) and <a href="../rgenoud">rgenoud</a> (R Version of
GENetic Optimization Using Derivatives).  The code uses C++ code
extensively.  The two benchmark scripts are available <a
href="GenMatch.R">here (Genetic Matching)</a> and <a
href="matching.R">here (Matching)</a>.  All benchmarks were done using
R-2.3 and gcc 4.  The best timing result of the three calls to <a
href="../Matching/GenMatch.html">GenMatch</a> in the GenMatch <a
href="GenMatch.R">script</a> are presented and the best result of
three consecutive runs of the <a href="matching.R">matching</a> script
are presented (examining the worst or the average times yields the
same substantive results).

Both Linux and Windows XP are significantly faster than OS X.  And
Linux is somewhat faster than Windows XP. In one thousand iterations
of the benchmark, Linux and Windows are always faster than OS X, and
Linux is always at least twice as fast as OS X.  This benchmark does
not take up much RAM, less than 30meg, nor does it work the filesystem
much.  But the application does flip between various shared libraries
and copy various data objects back and forth in RAM.  The following
benchmark takes about the same amount of RAM, but unlike the previous
one it does not flip between various shared libraries and makes many
fewer calls to malloc().  It does call a shared library, but it only
does it once and only passes results back once.

<br><br>

<img src="matching2.png" alt="matching2">

<br><br>

This second benchmarks looks better for OS X, but it is still about
1.2 times slower than Linux.  In one thousand iterations of the
benchmark, Linux is always faster than OS X.  And the gap between
Linux and Windows has grown from about 5 to about 10 percent.

<br><br>

<I> These benchmarks do not use a graphical user interface. They are
batch jobs run from the command line and produce no graphical
output.  </I> No X11 or Aqua calls are made. And on all platforms the
benchmark process obtains 99%+ of a cpu or core.  Moreover, in neither
benchmark are we testing IO or running multiple processes on the same
chip.  If we do either of these, the <a
href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_8825,00.html">Opteron's</a>
relative performance improves.

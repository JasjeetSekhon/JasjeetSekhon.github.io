<h4 class="General Review">General Review</h4>

What about OS X for more general computing applications?  After a few days of
the Mac being my main desktop, I could no longer take it.  I switched back to
my Linux box.  My Linux box has two monitors.  There is a third monitor which
I switch between XP and OS X.  I run everything with just a single keyboard
and mouse either through my KVM or even better through <a
href="http://www.rdesktop.org">rdesktop (RDP)</a> to Windows and <a
href="http://www.tightvnc.com">Tight VNC</a> to OS X (VNC controls the mouse
and keyboard but I look at the actual monitor for the Mac screen output).

<br><br>

To make a long story short, the Mac has not been useful to me.  I only use it
to run iTunes.  I cannot even use it to do video editing!?!  I convert video
from my PVR to mpeg-ts (mpegpes) on Windows XP.  I do this using <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directshow/htm/usinggraphedit.asp">DirectShow
Filters via graphedit</a> which is an awesome interface to various video
tools---one of Microsoft's biggest weapons has long been wonderful development
tools.  In this way, I can turn PVR files into portable mpeg-ts files.  Which
I can watch or burn to DVD for personal use.  The problem?  I cannot edit
mepg-ts files using any Apple tool I can find.  I could use <a
href="http://www.alfanet.it/squared5/mpegstreamclip.html">third party
software</a> or open source stuff like <a
href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/index.html">mencoder and mplayer</a>,
but I might as well then use Linux (where the software runs much faster
because of the OS and because I can run the software on an <a
href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_8825,00.html">Opteron</a>).
On Windows, I can *easily* burn my shows to dvd using <a
href="http://www.nero.com/">Nero</a> which is fast and user friendly. I cannot
use iDVD because it relies on Quicktime and QT does not support mpeg-ts.  So,
the Mac does not "just work" even for video editing.  mpeg-ts is hardly an
obscure format.  And no, I do not want to add an encoding step to switch
mpeg-ts to some Quicktime format just to change it again for burning to a dvd
using iDVD.  But if an encoding step is okay for you, you can use <a
href="http://www.alfanet.it/squared5/mpegstreamclip.html">MPEG Steamclip for
OS X</a>, but it is slower than mplayer under Linux (particularly mplayer on
x86 Linux).

When Tiger was first released it had a TON of bugs.  This is what
happens when the beta testing setup is mostly secret---much like a
Bush rally, you need the secret decoder ring to get in.  Apple does
this because it wants the secrecy to generate buzz in the consumer
market.  It doesn't really care about enterprise users and it shows.
For a list of annoying bugs (which have admittedly since been
corrected) see my <a href="g5.html">previous benchmarks</a>.

<br><br>

To be clear, Apple doesn't really care about techie users.  People I
know who work there are very honest about this.  Apple thinks it is
cool that a few hard core and famous hackers (such as <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy">Bill Joy</a>) are using
their machines.  But that is not who they really care about.

<br><br>

The color quality of the Mac desktop is fantastic.  Whites really are
white and blues blue.  But the bad engineering of the OS as well as
the highly controlled nature of Apple's development model and
applications offends me.  Who would have thought that a decade after
the famous <a
href="http://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/ads.html">1984 Big Brother
ad</a>, it would be Apple with the highly controlled <a
href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/&e=9800">cathedral</a>
OS and IBM would be spending hundreds of millions of dollars on code
it allows anyone to <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/linux/">share and to
contribute to</a>?

<h1>The Varying Role of Voter Information Across Democratic Societies Webpage</h1>

<a href="http://jsekhon.fas.harvard.edu/">Jasjeet S. Sekhon</a>

<br><br> This website is for my project on the varying role voter information
plays across democratic societies.  Using new robust matching methods for
making causal inferences from survey data, I demonstrate that there are
profound differences between how voters behave in mature democracies versus
how they behave in new ones.  The problems of voter ignorance and
inattentiveness are not as serious in mature democracies as many analysts have
suggested but are of grave concern in new democracies.  Citizens in mature
democracies are able to accomplish something that citizens in fledgling
democracies are not: inattentive and poorly informed citizens are able to vote
like their better informed compatriots and hence need to pay little attention
to political events such as election campaigns in order to vote as if they
were attentive. <br> <br>

This software was used by me to produce the following working paper:
<a
href="http://jsekhon.fas.harvard.edu/papers/SekhonInformation.pdf">The
Varying Role of Voter Information across Democratic Societies.</a>
This paper includes some useful discussion of Matching, particularly
of the balance tests.  The robust propensity score methods discussed
in the paper will be included in a future version.  The core matching
estimator which is implemented is that of <a
href="http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~.aabadie.academic.ksg/">Alberto
Abadie</a> and <a href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~imbens/">Guido
Imbens</a>.  This algorithm provides principled standard errors when
matching is done with covariates or a known propensity score.  Ties
are handled in a deterministic and coherent fashion.

For details see their working paper entitled <a
href="http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~.aabadie.academic.ksg/sme.pdf">Large
Sample Properties of Matching Estimators for Average Treatment</a>.

<br><br> The easiest way to install the latest version (0.34), if you
have an active network connection, is to type in a <b><a
href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a></b> session: <br> <dl> <dd>
<B> > install.packages("Matching",
CRAN="http://jsekhon.fas.harvard.edu") </B>
</dl> </dd> 

<br> Alternatively, the package may be directly downloaded: <br> <dl>
<dd> Linux (x86) all versions: <a
href="http://jsekhon.fas.harvard.edu/R/CRAN/src/contrib/Matching_0.34.tar.gz">Matching_0.34.tar.gz</a><br>

Windows R-1.9: <a
href="http://jsekhon.fas.harvard.edu/R/CRAN/bin/windows/contrib/1.9/Matching_0.34.zip">Matching_0.34.zip</a><br>

Windows R-1.8: <a href="http://jsekhon.fas.harvard.edu/R/CRAN/bin/windows/contrib/1.8/Matching_0.34.zip">Matching_0.34.zip</a><br>
</dl> </dd>
<br>

<b><a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a></b> version 1.8.1 or
higher is required to use Matching. This is a large package so it may
take a few minutes to download if you have a slow network connection.

<br> <br>
The package includes the following user exposed functions, two replication datasets and
three demos:
<br> <dl> <dd> 
     <a href="Match.html">Match()</a> <br>
     <a href="MatchBalance.html">MatchBalance()</a><br>
     <a href="balanceMV.html">balanceMV()</a><br>
     <a href="balanceUV.html">balanceUV()</a><br>

     <a href="GerberGreenImai.Rout">GerberGreenImai demo</a><br>
</dl> </dd>
<br>

The package is under active development so please check back for
updates.  
<br><br>

The package currently only works on Linux or Windows (x86).  The
reason for this limitation is that <a href="Match.html">Match()
</a> relies on a compiled C/C++ modified version of Guido Imbens's <a
href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~imbens/estimators.shtml">Matlab
function</a>.  No knowledge of Matlab nor a Matlab license is required
to use the package.

<br><br> For more details on matching and causal inference see <a

Wand's Reading List</a>.

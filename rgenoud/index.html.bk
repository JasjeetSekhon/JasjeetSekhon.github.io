This webpage is for the distribution of the <A
href="http://www.r-project.org/"><B>R</B></A> version of GENOUD
(GENetic Optimized Using Derivatives).  Please <A
href="http://jsekhon.fas.harvard.edu/genoud/">click here</A> for
some background information on GENOUD.

<br><br> The easiest way to install the latest version (1.31), if you have an
active network connection, is to type in a <b><a
href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a></b> session: <br> <dl> <dd>
<B> > install.packages("rgenoud") </B>
</dl> </dd> 
<br> Alternatively, the package may be directly downloaded:

GENOUD is a function that combines evolutionary algorithm methods
with a derivative-based, quasi-Newton method to solve difficult
unconstrained optimization problems.  GENOUD is made to solve
problems that are nonlinear or perhaps even discontinuous in the
parameters of the function to be optimized.  When a statistical
model's estimating function (for example, a log-likelihood) is
nonlinear in the model's parameters, the function to be optimized will
usually not be globally concave and may contain irregularities such as
saddlepoints or discontinuous jumps.  Optimization methods that rely
on derivatives of the objective function may be unable to find any
optimum at all.  Multiple local optima may exist, so that there is no
guarantee that a derivative-based method will converge to the global
optimum.  On the other hand, algorithms that do not use derivative
information (such as pure GAs) are for many problems needlessly poor
at local hill climbing.  Most statistical problems are regular in the
neighborhood of the solution.  Therefore, for some portion of the
search space derivative information is useful.  GENOUD is relatively
flexible.  For example, recursive optimization is supported--GENOUD
may be used to optimize GENOUD.

<P>
The current version of GENOUD contains many improvements made over the
original version of GENOUD.  Some of the logic of GENOUD has been
rewritten including a few of the key algorithms.  The original ``C''
version of GENOUD extended and greatly modified a constrained
optimization program created by Michalewicz (1992). GENOUD is strictly
speaking written in ``C++''.  But most of the code base is ANSI-C
compatible. <BR> <BR>

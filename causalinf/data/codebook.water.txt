All variables except for "pcia.dpt" and "treat" are preceded by
"yxxxx.", where xxxx indicates the year for which the variables have
information.

For example, y1990.privatews is equal to one if water services were
private in year 1990 and equal to zero if water services were public
in year 1990, while y1996.privatews is equal to one if water services
were private in year 1996 and equal to zero if water services were
public in year 1996.

Only descriptions for the year 1990 are given. Descriptions for all
other years are analogous.

All mortality variables are in rates.

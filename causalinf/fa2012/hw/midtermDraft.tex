\section*{Instructions}

This is an ungraded practice exam.  The questions are as follows:
True/False (Q1) 10\%, analytical section (Q2,Q3, Q4) 40\%, and the
empirical section (Q5 50\%). We will not read computer code to find
your answer, although computer code necessary to replicate your
answers along with its output must be provided with the exam. Ideally,
an electronic version of your computer code will be emailed to Danny
in one message with the files included as attachments. Please include
your last name in the filenames of the attached files.


\paragraph{Problem 1}
 An alternative distance metric to the propensity score is
Mahalanobis distance. This metric reduces the multidimensional problem
of multivariate matching to a unidimensional problem. Although
Mahalanobis distance was originally developed for use with
multivariate Normal data, we often encounter covariates that are not
normally distributed. This problem will explore the implications of
these non-normal variables on this distance metric.
\vspace{1em}
\noindent 
   \begin{itemize}
     \item[a.]  When including a binary variable in a Mahalanobis distance metric,
will a binary variable with $p=1/2$ or a binary variable with $p$ near
zero be given greater weight by this distance metric? Prove why this
is true mathematically.
     \item[b.]
     How will this distance metric treat covariates with outliers? How
about covariates that have long-tailed distributions?
     \item[c.] Should we or shouldn’t we be concerned by the behavior of the
Mahalanobis distance metric for the covariate distributions described
in parts (a) and (b)? Why?
   \end{itemize}   



\paragraph{Problem 2}

For this problem, you will compare the 

critique ``The Fox News Effect: Media Bias
and Voting'', by Stefano Della Vigna and Ethan Kaplan. The paper can
be found here:
\url{http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/causalinf/papers/DellaVignaFoxNews.pdf}. Please
write a page or two addressing the following questions:

   \begin{itemize}
   \item[a.]  Describe and discuss the identification strategy of the
     paper. What are the weaknesses? What parts do you find
     convincing?
   \item[b.] Explain the importance of section III.A in the article?
     Would you do it any differently?
   \item[c.] Perform the following thought experiment: hold the
     estimation procedure in section III.B constant, and assuming that
     you have access to all existing data in the US, what data would
     you include to the improve the validity of the estimates? Now do
     the reverse. Holding the data constant, discuss what parts you
     would change and add to the estimation procedures to increase
     confidence in the validity of the results.
   \item[d.] Overall, are you convinced that their conclusions are
     correct?
\end{itemize}




\paragraph{Problem 3} 

For this problem, you will perform several matching exercises using
the ``Fox News Effect'' data.  The unit of observation are towns in
the US, and the treatment under study is the availability of Fox News
during the 2000 election season. The outcome (\texttt{reppresfv2p00m96}) is the
change in the Republican presidential vote share between 1996 and
2000. The dataset for this assignment only includes those towns with
pre-treatment outcome data, i.e. the change in the Republican
presidential vote share between 1988 and 1992 (\texttt{reppresfv2p92m88}). The
treatment indicator (\texttt{foxnews2000}) has been defined as equal to one if
the town’s cable system carried the Fox News network before the 2000
election. The dataset includes a set of demographic covariates from
the 2000 and 1990 census.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent The Fox news data is available here:
\url{http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/causalinf/data/hw6data.RData}.
The variables are described in the following file:
\url{http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/causalinf/data/hw6_codebook.txt}

%\vspace{1em}
%\noindent
%The dataset has 435 observations and was used in the article ``Water
%for Life: The Impact of the Privatization of Water Services on Child
%Mortality'', by S. Galiani, P. Gertler, and E. Schargrodsky (2005,
%Journal of Political Economy, volume 113).  The paper is here: \url{http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/causalinf/papers/GalianiWater.pdf}.

%\vspace{1em}
%\noindent The units of observation are municipalities in Argentina, and the
%treatment under study is the privatization of municipal water
%services. All 435 municipalities in this sample had public water
%services in the year 1990, but by the year 1999, 123 municipalities
%had privatized their water services. Of the 123 municipalities which
%privatized between 1990 and 1999, 83 municipalities did so between
%1998 and 1999. The original panel structure of the dataset has been
%simplified to a cross-section: for each municipality, the dataset you%
%will be working with has the covariates for each year between 1990 and
%1999.

%\vspace{1em}
%\noindent
%The treatment indicator has been defined as equal to one if the%
%municipality privatized its water services sometime between 1991 and
%1999, and equal to zero if a municipality whose water services were
%public in 1990 never privatized between 1991 and 1999. The outcomes of
%interest are total child mortality and child mortality from infectious
%parasitic diseases, i.e., water-borne diseases. Perinatal mortality
%is also of interest for the reasons discussed in Galiani, Gertler, and
%Schargrodsky (2005).  
% For the purposes of all questions on this exam except for the bonus
% question, when trying to find optimal balance, you can safely
% restrict yourself to the following baseline covariates and the
% nonlinear functions listed here:

\vspace{1em}
\noindent For parts (a) - (e) below, be sure to explicitly set seeds
to ensure that GenMatch recovers reproducible results,
i.e. \texttt{set.seed} in general, and in GenMatch \texttt{unif.seed}, \texttt{int.seed}.

\begin{itemize}
\item[a.] 

  Estimate the causal effect for the treated of a town carrying Fox
  news on the change in Republican presidential vote share between
  1996 and 2000.  In doing so, select a set of covariates to condition
  on, being sure to include higher order terms and interactions you
  think are appropriate.  Also include a propensity score when
  conditioning, and ``orthogonalize'' your other covariates using this
  propensity score. Report your balance statistics before and after
  matching using \texttt{MatchBalance}.  Are these effects
  significant?  What is the most interesting summary statistic when
  comparing change in Republican vote returns? How informative are
  mean differences? What are the mean differences?

\item[b.] Create a loss function in GenMatch that ensures that the
  function will not return a matched data set with worse balance on
  any variable in your BalanceMatrix than the balance obtained by
  matching on {\em just} your propensity score in part (a) -- as
  judged by eQQ-plots and difference of means. Do this so that this
  property holds by design -- i.e., it holds regardless of the dataset
  used. (Hint: To do this, you will have to both write a custom loss
  function and provide GenMatch with starting values for the covariate
  weights so that it begins with the matched dataset returned from
  using only the propensity score above.)  Match again on your
  orthogongalized covariates from above using this loss function.
  Present balance before and after matching using
  \texttt{MatchBalance}.  %Produce two QQ-Plots illustrating
%  improvement in balance on one important continuous covariate before
 % and after matching.

\item[c.] Now match using the method from part (b) only using
  demographic covariates.  Estimate the ``treatment effect'' of the
  introduction of Fox news prior to the 2000 election on the pre-treatment
  outcome of change in Republican presidential vote share between
  1988 and 1992. This is known as a ``placebo test''. Can you recover a
  0 ATT estimate using only demographic covariates as the conditioning
  set?

%\item[c.] Estimate a post-matching parametric bias adjustment method
%  on the matched dataset you obtained in part (b), such as a
%  regression model. Does this make a difference for the inferences
%  drawn after matching? 

\item[d.] Overall, how do your results differ from those in DellaVigna and
  Kaplan (2007)? Are your results and their results comparable?  

%\item[e.] In this study, does SUTVA limit what we can say? If so, how?
%  If not, why not?  

\item[e.] [BONUS QUESTION]. Freed of the constraints in the previous
parts, find the best matching method (and possibly post-matching
  adjustment model) to answer the substantive question at hand. How
  confident are you that this is an unbiased estimate of the Fox news
  effect?  What do we learn about the effects of media bias from this analysis?    





%\item[c.] Estimate the ATT of privatizing
 % water services between 1991 and 1999 on child mortality in 1999,
 % using your matched data from part (b).  Is the ATT estimate
 % statistically different from zero?  Plot the density of the unit effects of treatment on
  %the treated municipalities.  Does your interpretation of the effect
  %of privatization change when examining average versus unit effects?    

%  What is the most interesting summary statistic when comparing child
%  mortality across the two groups? How informative are mean
%  differences? What are the mean differences?

%\item[d.] Using the same covariates from (a) and (b), rerun GenMatch, this
 % time dropping at most 10\% of the treated units. Does your balance
  %improve with respect to the balance you found in part (b)? Now what
 % is the ATT of privatization in this matched data?  Is the ATT
 % significantly different from zero?  


%\item[e.] Now find the best balance with GenMatch using your own loss
 % function.  In doing so, retain every other specification you used in
 % GenMatch in part (d).  Explain the logic behind your choice of loss
  %function. (An example loss function would maximize the median
  %$p$-value from a vector of \texttt{t.test} and \texttt{ks.test}
  %results). In your loss function, you may want to prioritize
  %important selection variables, for instance pre-treatment mortality
  %rates. Present balance statistics after matching using
  %\texttt{MatchBalance}.

%\item[f.] Overall, how do your results differ from those in Galiani,
 % Gertler, and Schargrodsky (2005)?  In particular, are your results
  %in part (b) and (c), and their published findings comparable? 

\end{itemize}

\end{document}


\item[a.] Create a loss function that ensures that GenMatch will not return a matched data set with worse balance on any variable in BalanceMatrix than the balance obtained by your matching method used in part a—as judged by eQQ-plots and difference of means. Do this so that this property holds by design—i.e., it holds regardless of the dataset used. In order to make this happen, you will have to both write a custom loss function (you may alter the one created in question “c” or write a new one), and provide GenMatch with starting.values so that it starts with the pscore matched dataset. Report your balance statistics after using this loss function.

\item[a.] Pick the matching method that produced, in your judgement, the best
balance. Estimate treatment effects and report them. How do they
differ from the reported estimates?

\item[a.] Select a set of covariates to condition on. Be sure to consider if any higher order terms and interactions are appropriate. Using these variables, perform Mahnolobis distance matching on a propensity score and “orthogo- nalized” covariates, with ATT as your estimand. Report your balance statistics, preferably using a plot.

\item[a.] Now using the same set of covariates (propensity score and “orthogonalized” covariates), use GenMatch to generate weights that optimize balance. Use the default setting for the loss function, but feel free to adjust other parameters of the function. Present balance before and after matching.

\item[a.] Now find balance with GenMatch using your own loss function. Explain the logic behind your choice of loss function. You may want to prioritize important selection variables, such as age. Present balance statistics after matching.

   \item[b.] Now with the same set of covariates, use GenMatch to
     generate weights that optimize balance. Use the default setting
     for the loss function, but feel free to adjust other parameters
     of the function. Present balance before and after matching, as
     well as your effect estimates. How is your estimate different
     from the results reported in the paper and your findings in part
     a?
   \item[c.] Now match using either the method from part (a) or the
     method from part (b), using only demographic covariates. Estimate

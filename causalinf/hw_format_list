Hi Jas, 

Here are the ten commandments of problem set formatting. The eight and nine
are my favorites. 

Cheers, 
Rocio


The answers to the problem sets should respect the following format: 
    
1. The name of the student, the name of the course, the date, and the number
of problem set must be included as a title in the first page.

2. All pages must numbered

3. The pages must be stapled

4. The body of the problem set must contain only the answers to the
questions. Every answer should be separated from the other by a title that
indicates the number of the specific question that is being answered.

5. The answers should contain a written response to the question (when
appropriate), and a table with the requested results (when appropriate).

6. All programming code must be included at the end of the problem set as an
appendix. The code must be adequately formatted so that it can be clearly
read. 

7. The programming code must be separated by question, indicating clearly
the where the programming for each question beings with titles. 

8. The answers should not be between lines in the programming code. 

9. No printouts of the R console will be accepted. All R outputs must be
arranged into tables and included in the answers to the questions in the
body of the problem set. 

10. In general, the format of the problem sets should be in the spirit of a
report, where you answer each question in detail with the objective of
reaching some general conclusion about the data analysis you are doing.

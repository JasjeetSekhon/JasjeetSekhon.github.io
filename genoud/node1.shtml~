Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
We report on technology we have developed to estimate models that pose
difficult optimization problems.  Optimization difficulties arise when
a model's estimating equations are not globally concave.  This is
often the case with nonlinear models.  A log-likelihood, for example,
may have local optima, saddle points, boundary solutions or be
discontinuous.  In such cases, methods of optimization that depend
entirely on derivatives (e.g., Newton-Raphson or quasi-Newton methods)
can be unreliable and often are virtually unusable.  Even in models
where such methods can be expected to work most of the time,
resampling techniques such as the bootstrap (Efron and Tibshirani
1993; Hall 1992) can generate resamples in which the standard
derivative-based optimization algorithms encounter severe
difficulties.  This is unfortunate because the most frequently used
optimization methods in econometric applications are entirely gradient
based.

<P>
The optimizing computer program that we have developed combines
evolutionary algorithm methods with a quasi-Newton method.  The
quasi-Newton method is the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)
(Gill, Murray and Wright 1981, 119).  When the BFGS is being used, our
program offers the option of using either built-in numerical
derivatives or user-supplied analytical derivatives.  Our program can
also work without the BFGS, in which case no derivatives are needed
and the optimizer will even work when the function is discontinuous.
Appropriate use of the BFGS can make the algorithm converge to the
global optimum much more quickly.  But premature or excessive use of
the BFGS can prevent convergence to the global optimum.  Our program
does not eliminate the need for judgment, testing and patience.

<P>
Our program, written in C (Kernighan and Ritchie 1988), extends and greatly
modifies a constrained optimization program created by Michalewicz (1992).
The acronym for the optimizing core of our program is GENOUD (GENetic
Optimization Using Derivatives).  We and others have successfully used
GENOUD to solve numerous optimization problems arising in the statistical
estimation of and inference from a number of nonlinear models, including
four-dimensional Hopf (4DH) models (Mebane 1997), an endogenous switching
tobit regression model (Mebane and Wawro 1996), a model for mobility in the
U.S. House (Wawro 1996), and Markov Chain models for rolling cross-section
data (Mebane and Wand 1997).  The most widely used statistical procedure to
which GENOUD has been applied is covariance structure models of the LISREL
and EQS type (Mebane and Sekhon 1995).  Our modified GENOUD program for
covariance structures is called GENetic optimization, with Bootstrapping,
of LInear Structures (GENBLIS).  The GENBLIS source code, documentation and
working papers are available at
<A NAME="tex2html9"
 HREF="http://data.fas.harvard.edu/jsekhon/genblis/"><TT>http://data.fas.harvard.edu/jsekhon/genblis/</TT></A>.In

GENBLIS we not only provide a fix to the optimization problem, we also
  implement bootstrap techniques which enable one to make inferences where
  analytical methods are difficult or impossible to use and to obtain
  estimates that are robust in the face of deviations from normality.  The
  use of these bootstrap techniques would have been highly unreliable
  without GENOUD.  As noted above, such methods generate resamples in which
  severe optimization difficulties arise when the objective function is not
  globally concave.

<P>
In this paper, we discuss the theory of random search algorithms which
supports the assertion that GENOUD has a high probability of finding
global optima when such exist.  We present results from Monte Carlo
experiments using some simple (but fiendish) scalar Normal mixture
models to illustrate this capability and to compare GENOUD's abilities
with those of an enhanced derivative based algorithm.  We then compare
the performance of GENOUD with a Gauss-Newton algorithm by using both
to estimate a least-squares variant of Mebane's (1997) nonlinear 4DH
model.

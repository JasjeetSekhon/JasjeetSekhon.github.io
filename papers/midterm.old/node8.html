In the coordinating model, every elector anticipates a post-election policy
that is intermediate between the parties' positions, unless <IMG

this sense, the MLEs suggest that all electors are using moderating
strategies.  The coordinating model MLEs for <IMG

every year except 1986 (see Table <A HREF="node13.html#tab:mles">1</A>), suggesting that electors expected
the president to be weaker than the House in determining post-midterm policy.

House was expected to be closer to the Democratic position in 1978, 1982, 1986
and 1990, closer to the Republican position in 1994 and 1998.

The moderating mechanism of the coordinating model is capable of generating a
midterm cycle of the kind emphasized by Alesina and Rosenthal (1989; 1995;
1996), in which the president's party loses vote share in House races at
midterm.  To determine whether the model implies such a cycle, we need a
baseline measure of the effect policy-related incentives have on choices in
the presidential election year preceding each midterm.  For such a measure we
use Mebane's (2000, Table 7) estimates of the proportion of presidential-year
voters for whom each combination of presidential and House choices would
minimize expected policy-related losses.  Mebane's estimates, for presidential
election years 1976-96, are based on his coordinating voting
model.<A NAME="tex2html47"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1456"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  Consider the proportion of voters
in a presidential election who would minimize their expected policy-related
losses by voting for a House candidate of the same party as the new president.
There is a policy-related foundation for a midterm cycle if that proportion is
greater than the proportion of voters in the subsequent midterm who would
minimize their policy-related losses by voting for a candidate of the same
party as the president.  Table <A HREF="node13.html#tab:orderings">5</A> shows that such a pattern occurs
for all six midterm elections.  The decline in the proportion from
presidential year to midterm is considerably smaller for 1998 than for the
other years.<A NAME="tex2html48"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1657"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>

<P>
In the coordinating model there is a systematic foundation for a midterm
cycle: the equilibrium Republican House vote share each elector expects at the
time of the presidential election is no longer an equilibrium once the
identity of the president becomes known.  A consequence of the post-election
disequilibrium is that the probability that each elector votes for a House
candidate of the president's party decreases.  The aggregation of such changes
is the cycle-generating mechanism.

<P>
It is not possible, however, to say precisely how much of the change we
observe in votes from presidential election to midterm is due purely to the
post-election disequilibrium that the disappearance of uncertainty about the
identity of the president brings about.  Simulation using presidential-year
NES data and Mebane's (2000) coordinating voting model suggest that
immediately after the presidential election, due solely to the identity of the
new president having become known, the equilibrium proportion of House votes
for the new president's party typically falls by values ranging from about .01
to about .06.<A NAME="tex2html49"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1659"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A> The simulated loss is substantially smaller than the corresponding
decrease in policy-related support for the president's party shown in
Table <A HREF="node13.html#tab:orderings">5</A> for each midterm year except 1998.  Other factors that
change between the presidential and midterm elections seem clearly to be
modulating the magnitude of the policy-related midterm losses.  Such factors
include the fact that the president is usually expected to have less influence
on policy after midterm than after the preceding presidential
election.<A NAME="tex2html50"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1660"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A> The form of each elector's evaluation of the
policy-related losses also changes: at midterm an elector's evaluation of the
expected policy-related loss does not depend on the elector's retrospective
evaluation of the economy, as it does in during presidential election
years.<A NAME="tex2html51"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1661"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  And between elections
parties may change their policy positions, or voters may change their ideal
points, and substantively different policies come into play.

Introduction</A>
</H1>
Do Americans coordinate their electoral choices in midterm congressional
elections?  Based on empirical tests of a rational expectations equilibrium
model of voters' choices among candidates for president and for the House of
Representatives, Mebane (2000) argues that there is coordination among voters
in presidential elections.  The strategic theory of policy moderation
introduced by Alesina and Rosenthal (1989; 1995; 1996), which motivates
Mebane's analysis, envisions each voter acting according to a unified strategy
that spans both the presidential and midterm elections.  In Alesina and
Rosenthal's theory, each voter's rational expectation about what the aggregate
of voters will do at midterm constrains the voter's actions during the
preceding presidential election.  From the perspective of such a unified
theory, a demonstration of coordination in presidential-year voting is
incomplete without a comparable demonstration of coordination at midterm.  We
use an extension of Mebane's (2000) fixed-point methods to develop a model of
strategic equilibrium based on rational expectations among midterm electors.
We test the model by using National Election Studies (NES) survey data from
the six midterm elections of years 1978 through 1998 to estimate a stochastic
choice model that respects the primary fixed-point constraint of the formal
model.

<P>
One of the most important implications of Alesina and Rosenthal's theory is an
explanation of midterm loss.<A NAME="tex2html18"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot333"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  According to their theory, each voter chooses a
congressional candidate during the presidential-year election to match the
voter's expectation regarding the presidential outcome, which is uncertain.
Some voters who voted for a congressional candidate of the president's party
when the presidential outcome was uncertain would have voted for the other
party had they known which presidential candidate would win.  At midterm such
voters change their votes, so that at midterm the president's party loses
congressional vote share compared to the preceding presidential-election year.
Alesina and Rosenthal (1989; 1995; Alesina, Londregan and Rosenthal 1993) show
patterns in aggregate data that in several respects match the kind of midterm
cycle that their theory implies, but, as they observe, the midterm cycle
occurs too frequently to be fully consistent with their theoretical model
(Alesina and Rosenthal 1995, 207).<A NAME="tex2html19"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot334"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  We use the data
and parameter estimates from our model and from Mebane (2000) to confirm that
the disappearing uncertainty of Alesina and Rosenthal's theory accounts for
only a small part of the midterm cycles that occurred between 1976 and 1998.
The predominant part of the explanation for the frequency and magnitude of the
midterm cycles is a regular pattern of interelection changes in the
relationship between voters' policy ideal points and the policy positions they
attribute to the parties.

<P>
An alternative explanation for midterm loss is the theory of surge and decline
(Campbell 1966).  This argument emphasizes differences in voter turnout
between the presidential election and midterm.  The details of the theory vary
somewhat in different accounts, but the central idea is that in the
presidential election there is a surge of people who turn out and vote for
candidates of the party that wins the presidency but who do not vote at
midterm.  The argument highlights the fact that Independents are more likely
to vote in the presidential election than at midterm, so that the midterm
electorate consists of a higher proportion of party identifiers whose vote
choices are relatively unmoved by short-run concerns (Campbell 1987).  Born
(1990) uses NES data from several elections to conduct individual-level tests
of various aspects of the theory, finding little if any support for
it.<A NAME="tex2html20"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot335"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  In our
empirical assessments using NES data we find that the changes that
systematically occur between the presidential election and midterm do not
match the pattern suggested by the theory of surge and decline.

<P>
The need to address the theory of surge and decline is one reason why midterm
nonvoters are relevant.  Even apart from the surge and decline theory, it is
important not to ignore the fact that turnout is lower at midterm than in the
presidential election and that different kinds of people turn out at midterm.
Apparent differences between midterm and presidential election voters may be
nothing more than sample selection phenomena.  Also there is a question
whether decisions to vote are also coordinated through rational expectations.
In our models we consider the population of everyone who is eligible to
vote--henceforth, the population of <I>electors</I>.

<P>
We assume that each elector has the same basic institutional understanding
that is attributed to voters in the theories of Alesina and Rosenthal (1995;
1996) and Mebane (2000).  Each elector knows post-election policy outcomes are
compromises between the positions taken by the president and the Congress, and
each elector believes the two political parties push for distinct policy
alternatives.  In our theory most--not all--electors care about the policy
outcomes.  An elector may vote for one of the parties or not vote.  An elector
is acting to moderate policy when the elector chooses what to do based on the
idea that, via the institutional structure, the policy outcome will be
intermediate between the parties' positions.  As in Mebane (2000), there is a
coordinating equilibrium when each elector makes the best possible assessment
of what the election outcome will be and then uses that assessment to act in
the way that is most likely to produce the best possible result for the
elector.

<P>
The equilibrium concept in our model is the same as in Mebane (2000):
coordination is a noncooperative rational expectations equilibrium among
electors.<A NAME="tex2html21"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot337"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  Each elector is able to make an equilibrium strategic choice that
is based on accurate expectations regarding the aggregate results of other
electors' intended choices.  Different electors have beliefs about the
upcoming election results that are very similar but not exactly the same in
equilibrium.  As in the model of Mebane (2000), the similarity is a result of
common knowledge all electors have, while the differences are due to private
information each elector has.<A NAME="tex2html22"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot338"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  Our equilibrium includes the level of turnout along with the
two-party split of votes for House candidates.  Our model allows exogenous
factors to motivate an elector to vote, so our equilibrium is not a new
solution to the problem of obtaining substantial positive turnout in
equilibrium based purely on post-election policy considerations (cf. Hinich,
Ledyard and Ordeshook 1972; Enelow and Hinich 1984; Ledyard 1984; Palfrey and
Rosenthal 1985).

<P>
We use NES survey data from midterm election years 1978 through 1998 to
estimate a stochastic choice model that matches the theoretical model.  In
both models, different electors have different ideas about what the parties'
policy positions are.  As in Mebane (2000), the fixed-point values determined
in the empirical analysis estimate the aggregate values that are common
knowledge in equilibrium in the theoretical model.  Tests based on estimates
of the empirical model's parameters support the existence of coordination
among House electors in recent midterm years, with most electors acting to
moderate policy.

<P>
We also compare the coordinating model to an empirical model that applies to
midterm elections the core idea in the nonstrategic theory that Fiorina (1988;
1992, 73-81) introduced to describe institutional balancing by voters in
elections during presidential years.  Mebane (2000) finds the nonstrategic
theory to be significantly inferior to his coordinating theory in terms of fit
to NES data from presidential election years 1976-1996.  Our nonstrategic
model fits the midterms data significantly worse than the coordinating model
does, and the estimated parameters of the nonstrategic model do not support an
interpretation that there is nonstrategic institutional balancing.

Surge and Decline</A>
</H1>
The theory of surge and decline suggests one possible reason for the
relationship between voters' most preferred policies and the policy positions
they attribute to the parties to change in a systematic way between the
presidential and midterm elections.  According to the theory, during the
heightened mobilization of presidential elections more electors with marginal
political involvement turn out to vote than during midterm elections.  The
theory conjectures that this group disproportionately votes for the party of
the winning presidential candidate.  At midterm, however, this group of
electors does not vote (Campbell 1966).<A NAME="tex2html52"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1475"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  Perhaps the surge of marginal electors who,
according to the theory, vote for House candidates of the same party as the
presidential winner do so because they like that party's policy position
better than the other party's policy position.  Then at midterm such electors
for some reason disproportionately do not vote.  In particular it may be that
Independents who favored the policy position of the presidential
winner's party are less likely to vote at midterm than partisan identifiers
are to do so, simply because (as is well known and as the estimate for <IMG
 WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img332.gif"
 ALT="$ d_I$">
in Table <A HREF="node13.html#tab:mles">1</A> reconfirms) Independents are less likely to vote at
midterm.  All together the surge and decline theory posits that the midterm
decline in turnout should have two major effects.  On average, midterm voters
should tend to have policy ideal points that are farther from the president's
party than presidential-year voters do, and midterm nonvoters should tend to
have policy ideal points that are closer to the president's party than
presidential-year nonvoters do.

<P>
We show that NES data from the elections of 1976 through 1998 do not support
the existence of such a surge and decline mechanism, although between
presidential election and midterm the differences between electors' ideal
points and the positions they attribute to the parties do change in a
regularly repeated pattern.  For most electors, turnout at midterm is only
weakly related to expected policy-related losses.  And the proximity between
electors' ideal points and the positions electors attribute to the parties
does not vary between elections in the way surge and decline theory would
predict.

<P>
In the empirical coordinating model of (<A HREF="node4.html#eq:GEVxuse">12</A>a-c) and
(<A HREF="node4.html#eq:Guse">13</A>), the policy-related loss expected by elector <IMG

  HREF="footnode.html#foot1663"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>The small size of these effects means that they will usually be dominated by
other factors, such as partisanship per se, that much more strongly affect the
probability of not voting.

<P>
Nonetheless the possibility remains that midterm voters see themselves as
farther from the president's party on policy than presidential-year voters do,
while midterm nonvoters see themselves as closer to the policy of the
presidential winner's party than do presidential-year nonvoters.  In the
absence of an explicit analysis of presidential-year turnout in the context of
a coordinating model, we cannot be sure that expected policy-related loss
affects the probability of casting a vote for the House election as weakly
then as it does at midterm.  Unfortunately, such a model is difficult to
define and estimate.<A NAME="tex2html55"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1495"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  Therefore we examine
the policy proximities directly.

<P>
To do so we use the coordinating model parameter estimates of Mebane (2000) to
compute ideal points (<IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img296.gif"
 ALT="$ \theta_i$">) and party policy positions (<!-- MATH

and <!-- MATH

<IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img16.gif"

presidential election year from 1976 through 1996.  We define a voter to be
anyone who reports having voted for either the Democrat or the Republican in
the House race and a nonvoter to be anyone who does not report such a vote.
We include only those who report at least one complete set of policy position
values.<A NAME="tex2html56"

Figure <A HREF="node14.html#fig:6setB">1</A> summarizes the data that most directly bear on the pattern

panel in Figure <A HREF="node14.html#fig:6setB">1</A> displays for each year the median of the absolute
differences for a different set of electors.  Panel (a) shows the medians for
all voters and nonvoters, and the remaining panels show the medians for each
of the seven NES types of party identifiers.

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
*** Figure <A HREF="node14.html#fig:6setB">1</A> about here ***</DIV>

<P>
Figure <A HREF="node14.html#fig:6setB">1</A> provides little support for the idea that surge and decline
explains the varying magnitudes of changes from the presidential-year to
midterm reported in Table <A HREF="node13.html#tab:orderings">5</A>.  Among all voters
(Figure <A HREF="node14.html#fig:6setB">1</A>(a)), the median absolute difference between each voter's
ideal point and the position the voter attributes to the presidential winner's
party is always greater at midterm than it is during the preceding
presidential election year.  That does match the pattern predicted by the
surge and decline theory.  But in every case except one, the median absolute
difference is also greater at midterm among all nonvoters.  The sole exception
is 1994, when the median absolute difference is slightly smaller among
nonvoters than it is among nonvoters in 1992.  The pattern among nonvoters
does not match what surge and decline theory predicts.

<P>
The closest match to the pattern predicted by the surge and decline theory
occurs among Independent Independents (Figure <A HREF="node14.html#fig:6setB">1</A>(b)), but even there
the support for surge and decline is weak at best.  In three of the six cases
there are decreases at midterm in the median absolute difference among
nonvoters.  The decreases occur in 1978, 1990 and 1994.  But in the remaining
three midterms the median absolute difference increases from the preceding
presidential year among nonvoters.  Moreover, in one of the six cases (1990)
the median absolute difference decreases among voters.  There is hardly any
support for surge and decline in the data for Independent Democrats and
Independent Republicans (Figure <A HREF="node14.html#fig:6setB">1</A>(e) and <A HREF="node14.html#fig:6setB">1</A>(f)).  Among
nonvoters there are nine instances where the median absolute difference
increases at midterm and only three instances where it decreases at midterm.
Moreover, among Independent Democrats there are two instances (1990 and 1998)
where the median absolute difference for voters decreases at midterm and among
Independent Republicans there is one instance (1998).

<P>
Instead of the pattern that the surge and decline theory predicts, what we see
is that typically both voters and nonvoters are farther from the policy of the
president's party at midterm than they were at the time that the party won
the presidency in the preceding election.  Compared to voters, nonvoters are
somewhat more likely to be on average closer to the president's party at
midterm, but the difference between voters and nonvoters does not occur with a
regularity sufficient to make surge and decline a compelling summary of what
is going on.

Moderation by Changes in Policy Positions</A>
</H1>
Figure <A HREF="node14.html#fig:6setB">1</A> shows that the absolute difference between electors' ideal
points and the policy positions of the party that won the presidential
election usually increases at midterm.  The increase among all voters in the
median absolute difference is larger than 0.1 in one of the six election
cycles and larger than 0.05 in two others.<A NAME="tex2html57"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1665"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  This is on a policy scale
that has a defined range of zero to one.  Notwithstanding that the pattern
does not match the predictions of the theory of surge and decline, the
increases are large enough to contribute significantly to the magnitudes of
the policy-related midterm losses shown in Table <A HREF="node13.html#tab:orderings">5</A>.
Figure <A HREF="node14.html#fig:6setB">1</A> is a bit one-sided, however, because it summarizes the
relationship between electors' ideal points and only one party's policy
positions.  But the expected policy-related losses that affect vote choices
depend on both parties' policies.

<P>
Alesina and Rosenthal's (1995, Chapter 4; 1996) model uses a stylized
perturbation of voters' policy preferences to generate uncertainty about the
presidential election outcome.  The perturbation they define shifts voters'
ideal points relative to both parties' positions, but the perturbation is
unbiased and therefore does not systematically increase either the absolute
distance between voters and the party that won the presidency or the net
distance compared to the other party.  Moreover, the difference between the
midterm and presidential-year legislative cutpoints that occurs in their model
does not depend on those distances.<A NAME="tex2html58"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1515"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  The changes from presidential year to midterm in ideal points
and in party positions that underlie Figure <A HREF="node14.html#fig:6setB">1</A>, and the degree to which
such changes contribute to midterm losses by the president's party, are
therefore not encompassed by this aspect of Alesina and Rosenthal's theory.

<P>
To assess the components of change it is important to consider not merely the
magnitudes but also the directions in which the aggregate of voters moves with
respect to the parties.  Consider a situation in which all voters think the
Democratic party policy position is left of the Republican party position,
i.e., <!-- MATH
 $\theta_{Di}<\theta_{Ri}$
 -->

 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img13.gif"
 ALT="$ i$">.  We may characterize the
aggregate movement across elections in terms of two median statistics: the
median difference between ideal points and Democratic positions, denoted
<!-- MATH

 -->
<IMG

then between elections the distribution of voters' ideal points has moved to
the left relative to both parties' positions, Republican House vote share
decreases and, if a Republican is president, there is moderation of expected
policy toward the midterm Democratic position.

<P>
Moderation via such a pattern of changes occurs in five of the six midterm
elections from 1978 through 1998, according to NES data.  Using NES data to
compute the median differences between ideal points and the parties'
positions, it is necessary to adjust for the fact that some voters place the
Democratic party policy position to the right of the Republican party
position: for some voters, <!-- MATH
 $\theta_{Di}>\theta_{Ri}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img370.gif"
 ALT="$ \theta_{Di}&gt;\theta_{Ri}$">.  Because moderation
essentially refers to movement from one party toward the other and does not
depend on the orientation with which each voter interprets its ideal point and
the parties' positions, we use the sign of the difference between

Figure <A HREF="node14.html#fig:0vsetB">2</A>(a) shows that among all voters, in every midterm except 1998

because between 1996 and 1998 the distribution of voters' ideal points shifted
to the left relative to both parties' positions.<A NAME="tex2html60"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1560"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  The pattern of interelection changes
is similar across all of the partisan subsets and within each subset is by and
large similar to the pattern among all voters, except for 1988-90.  Between

 SRC="img366.gif"
 ALT="$ \Delta_R&lt;0$"> differs from the mechanism of disappearing uncertainty that is
the primary focus of Alesina and Rosenthal's analysis, but it is not
necessarily inimical to their theory.  The fluctuations in policy positions
may be related to the idea that parties may commit to policies different from
their ideal policies (Alesina and Rosenthal 1995, 127-136).  The consequences
of such an extension for Alesina and Rosenthal's formal analysis are
complicated, but an important result they report is that under a wide range of
circumstances parties announce policies that are more polarized than their
ideal policies are.  Moreover, polarization increases as the president's power
(<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$ \alpha $">) falls.  As we mentioned previously (footnote <A HREF="node8.html#fn:alpha">33</A>), the
combination of our estimates with those of Mebane (2000) shows that <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$ \alpha $">
is usually smaller at midterm than at the time of the presidential election:
voters usually believe the president will be more powerful before midterm than
after.  Alesina and Rosenthal (1995) do not examine models in which <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$ \alpha $">
changes at midterm, but it is reasonable to speculate that in such
models--with as well the parties being allowed to change their positions at
midterm--there would be a tendency for polarization to increase at midterm.
In that case one should expect the relationships between voter ideal points
and the parties' positions to change by larger and more systematically biased
amounts than the changes produced by random perturbations.

<P>
The NES data from 1976 through 1998 mostly support the idea that polarization
is greater at midterm.  Among voters, the median absolute difference between
the parties' positions is smaller in the presidential election than at midterm
in five of the six pairs of elections (the exception is 1988-90).<A NAME="tex2html62"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1669"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  The
interelection changes in the median absolute differences are, however, small
compared to the observed magnitudes of <IMG
 WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img367.gif"
 ALT="$ \Delta_D$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img368.gif"
 ALT="$ \Delta_R$">.  These
results are only suggestive, because by construction our measures of party
positions are within the unit interval <IMG
 WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.gif"
 ALT="$ [0,1]$"> in every year.  Moreover,
different voters attend to different combinations of substantive issues, and
the mix of salient issues changes over years (the changes over the years in
the issue scales included in the NES partly reflects the variation in
substantive concerns over time).  Increased polarization may take the form of
greater emphasis being placed on substantive issues about which voters'
preferences are more intense.

<P>
The changes <IMG
 WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img367.gif"
 ALT="$ \Delta_D$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img368.gif"
 ALT="$ \Delta_R$"> may also arise because voters learn
something after the presidential election.  They may learn more about what a
party's true policy position is, or about a policy position's consequences.
Or they may learn how competent the elected officials are to implement
whatever policy happens to be in effect.<A NAME="tex2html63"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1569"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  Either kind of discovery might be a reason for a voter to
update the relationship between the voter's ideal point and the positions the
voter attributes to the parties.  A party's actions either in the presidency
or in Congress might be informative.  Perhaps, for instance, the
Democrat-favoring changes shown in Figure <A HREF="node14.html#fig:0vsetB">2</A> for 1996 to 1998 stem
from judgments that Republicans in the House were especially incompetent or
extreme.<A NAME="tex2html64"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1571"><SUP>footnote</SUP></A>  The
unanswered question is why are movements away from the president's party more
typical.  Why do electors not learn more often that the president's party is
more competent or less extreme than they previously thought.

<P>
One of the difficulties of explaining why moderation by policy position
changes occurs is that our policy position measures are based on the gaps
between electors' ideal points and the perceived positions of the two major
parties.  Across elections, we cannot distinguish between movement in
electors' ideal points and movements in the positions of the political
parties.  Therefore, we cannot say much regarding a large number of possible
explanations for policy position moderation.  For example, notwithstanding
Alesina and Rosenthal's polarization argument, it is possible that once a
party is in office it follows policies that are more extreme than the ones it
proposed at election time.  Electors may learn this and consequently the
relative gap between the president's party and electors increases at midterm.
Electors' ideal points remain fixed but their perceptions of the parties
change.  Such a theory would have the problem that it leaves unexplained how
electors are repeatedly misled to believe that the party that wins the White
House is more moderate than it actually is.  In any case, with our data we
cannot distinguish such a pattern from one in which electors change their
ideal points because, say, they learn more about the consequences different
policies have.

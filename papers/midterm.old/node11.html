Conclusion</A>
</H1>
The evidence that Americans coordinate their vote choices at midterm is
strong.  The NES data strongly confirm the strategic theory of policy
moderation.  The estimated parameters of the coordinating model satisfy all of
the conditions necessary to describe coordinating behavior.  The parameters of
the nonstrategic model fail to describe policy-moderating behavior, and the
nonstrategic model's fit to the data is significantly worse than that of the
coordinating model.  Coordination also affects decisions whether to vote, but
the effects on turnout probabilities are typically small.

<P>
Midterm loss is in part caused by policy moderation that occurs because
uncertainty about which party will control the presidency disappears after the
presidential election.  But the mechanism of disappearing uncertainty does not
itself explain why midterm losses are as large as they are, nor why midterm
losses occur as frequently as they do.  

<P>
The largest source of loss of support for the president's party at midterm is
a regularly repeated pattern in which by midterm the median differences
between voters' ideal points and the parties' policy positions have become
less favorable for the president's party than they were at the time of the
presidential election (the same pattern occurs among nonvoters).  Such a
pattern occurs in all five of the interelection periods during 1976-98 after
which the president's party suffered a midterm loss.  Between 1996 and 1998
the pattern reverses: the distribution of voters' ideal points and party
positions becomes more favorable to the Democratic party notwithstanding the
fact that Democrat Bill Clinton is president.  That reversal reduced the
proportion of midterm voters who would minimize their policy-related losses by
voting for a Republican, to such an extent that on the whole the Democrats
enjoyed a small midterm gain in 1998.

<P>
The policies involved in the interelection changes are not limited to
macroeconomic policy.  Indeed, only in 1980 do the NES survey items we use to
measure ideal points and party positions include scales that refer to
macroeconomic policy.
It may be that preferences about macroeconomic policy are strongly related to
preferences about policies to which NES survey items do refer.  For instance,
every NES survey includes scale items about fiscal policy (taxing and
spending).  But the plain fact is that the interelection changes we document
involve a wide range of policies, and the composition of the set of policies
changes over time.  Nonetheless, changes go in the same direction--away from
the president's party--during five of the six interelection periods our data
cover.

<P>
Why the interelection changes in the distribution of ideal points and policy
positions typically cut against the president's party is not clear.  The
dynamic is not explained by variations in turnout: nothing like surge and
decline is behind the pattern.
